    <h1>Privacy Policy for SeClip</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 12, 2025</p>

    <p>KuroAppWorks ("we," "our," or "us") operates the SeClip mobile application (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>

    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. All data you create within SeClip is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to us or any third party.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

    <h3>1. Data You Provide (Stored Locally):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Keywords and Secure Items:</strong> Any text, IDs, passwords, notes, or other information you save in the "Clips" and "Secure" tabs is stored exclusively in a local database on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Encrypted Data:</strong> Information saved in the "Secure" tab is encrypted using industry-standard AES-256 (GCM mode) encryption before it is saved to your device's local database. The decryption key is derived from your master password and is never stored in plaintext.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. App Settings and Preferences (Stored Locally):</h3>
    <p>Your app preferences, such as theme settings, font size, and whether to enable features like PIN or Biometric authentication, are stored locally on your device using Android's DataStore.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>

    <p>We take the security of your data very seriously.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Encryption at Rest:</strong> As mentioned, all items in the "Secure" tab are encrypted. Without your master password, this data is computationally infeasible to decrypt.</li>
        <li><strong>In-Memory Password Caching:</strong> To provide convenient access to the Secure tab (e.g., via PIN or biometrics), your master password may be temporarily held in your device's memory (RAM) after you successfully authenticate. This cache is cleared as soon as the app goes to the background or is closed, ensuring it does not persist.</li>
        <li><strong>Screen Security:</strong> To protect against visual data leakage, the Service utilizes Android's <code>FLAG_SECURE</code>. This prevents screenshots, screen recording, and the display of the app's content in the recent apps list (task switcher).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Backup and Restore</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User-Controlled Backups:</strong> The Service provides an optional feature to back up your data to a file of your choosing (e.g., on your device or cloud storage). This process is initiated entirely by you.</li>
        <li><strong>Backup File Security:</strong> If you choose to include "Secure Items" in your backup, the backup file will contain the encrypted data and the password hash from the time of backup.</li>
        <li><strong>Restore Security:</strong> To restore a backup containing secure items, you must provide the master password that was active when the backup was created. This ensures that only someone who possesses both the backup file and the correct password can access the encrypted information. The backup file alone is not sufficient to compromise your data.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Data Handling:</strong> All backup and restore processes occur locally on your device. Your data is not sent to our servers at any point.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>The Service uses Google AdMob to display advertisements to support its development.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> AdMob may collect and use data as described in Google's Privacy & Terms. This may include device identifiers, location data (if permissions are granted), and other information to serve personalized ads. You can learn more about Google's advertising policies here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></li>
        <li><strong>Rewarded Ads:</strong> You have the option to watch a rewarded video ad to temporarily disable all advertisements. This is a voluntary action.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Clipboard Management</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Clipboard Access:</strong> The core function of the app is to copy your saved information to the device's clipboard for your convenience.</li>
        <li><strong>Sensitive Data Handling (Android 13+):</strong> When copying items from the "Secure" tab on devices running Android 13 or higher, the data is marked as "sensitive." This signals to the Android operating system that the clipboard content should be hidden from previews and automatically cleared after a period of time (typically one hour, as determined by the OS).</li>
        <li><strong>Manual Clipboard Clearing:</strong> The Service provides an optional notification with a "Clear Clipboard" button. This allows you to manually clear the clipboard's contents at any time for enhanced security. This feature requires you to enable the persistent notification in the app's settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The Service may request the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Biometric/Fingerprint:</strong> To enable unlocking the "Secure" tab with your device's biometric sensors.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To provide a persistent notification for quick app access and the optional clipboard clearing feature.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the app. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:kuroappworks+contact@gmail.com">kuroappworks+contact@gmail.com</a></p>
